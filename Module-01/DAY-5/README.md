# Ex.No:1(E)  STATIC VARIABLE

## AIM:
To write a Java program to check if a person is eligible to write an exam based on their age (between 21 and 35 years).**

## ALGORITHM :
1.Start the program.

2.Create a Scanner object to read user input.

3.Declare an integer variable age.

4.Read the age from the user.

5.Check if the age is between 21 and 35 (inclusive):

6.If true, print "Eligible to Write Exam".

7.Else, print "Not Eligible to Write Exam".

8.End the program.

        int age=sc.nextInt();
        if(age>=21 && age<=35)
        {
            System.out.println("Eligible to Write Exam");
        }
        else
        {
            System.out.println("Not Eligible to Write Exam");
        }
    }
    
    public  static void main(String[] args) {
       Age obj=new Age();
       obj.calculateAge();
    }
}
