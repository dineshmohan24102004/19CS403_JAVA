# Ex.No:1(A) CLASS & OBJECTS

## AIM:
To create multiple objects of the class Fruit, assign values to their attributes (name, color, and weight), and display the details of each fruit.

## ALGORITHM :
1.Start

2.Create three instances of the class Fruit: obj1, obj2, and obj3.

3.Assign values to the properties of obj1:

Set name to "Grape".

Set color to "Purple".

Set weight to 0.75.

4.Assign values to the properties of obj2:

Set name to "Apple".

Set color to "Red".

Set weight to 2.50.

5.Assign values to the properties of obj3:

Set name to "Mango".

Set color to "Yellow".

Set weight to 1.50.

6.Print the details of each fruit object in the following format:

"Fruit Name is <name>, weight is <weight>kg and Color is <color>"

7.End
