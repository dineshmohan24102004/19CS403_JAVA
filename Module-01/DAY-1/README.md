# Ex.No:1(A) CLASS & OBJECTS

## AIM:
To create and display information about different fruit objects using a class in Java. Each fruit has properties: name, color, and weight.

## ALGORITHM :
1.Start the program.

2.Create a class Fruit with three instance variables: name, color, and weight.

3.In the main method:

4.Create three objects of the Fruit class: obj1, obj2, and obj3.

5.Assign values to each object's name, color, and weight.

6.Use System.out.println to print the details of each fruit object.

7.End the program.

        obj3.color="Yellow";
        obj3.weight=1.50;
        
        System.out.println("Fruit Name is "+obj1.name+",weight is "+obj1.weight+"kg"+" and Color is "+obj1.color);
        System.out.println("Fruit Name is "+obj2.name+",weight is "+obj2.weight+"kg"+" and Color is "+obj2.color);
        System.out.println("Fruit Name is "+obj3.name+",weight is "+obj3.weight+"kg"+" and Color is "+obj3.color);
