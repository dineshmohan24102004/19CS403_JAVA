# Ex.No:1(D) USER DEFINED METHOD.

## AIM:
To write a Java program to calculate the area of a square given its side length.

## ALGORITHM :
1.Start the program.

2.Declare two double variables: side and cirarea.

3.Create a Scanner object to read input from the user.

4.Read the length of the side of the square from the user.

5.Calculate the area using the formula:
6.Area = side Ã— side

7.Display the calculated area.

8.End the program.



## PROGRAM:
 ```
/*
Program to implement a User Defined Method using Java
Developed by: 
RegisterNumber:
    void calculateArea()
    {
        double side,cirarea;
        Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
        side=sc.nextDouble();
        cirarea=side*side;
        System.out.println("Area of Square is "+cirarea);
    }
*/
```


## OUTPUT:
