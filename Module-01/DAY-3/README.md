## AIM:
To write a Java program to check whether a given number is positive or negative.

## ALGORITHM :
1.Start the program.

2.Create a Scanner object to read input from the user.

3.Declare an integer variable num.

4.Read a number from the user and store it in num.

5.Check if num is less than 0:

6.If true, print "num is Negative".

7.Else, print "num is Positive".

8.End the program.





## PROGRAM:
 ```

import java.util.Scanner;

public class Demo
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int num;
        
        num = sc.nextInt();
        
        if(num<0)
        System.out.println(num+ " is Negative");
        
        else
        {
        	 System.out.println(num+ " is Positive");
        }
    }
}
